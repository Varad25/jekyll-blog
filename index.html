  <ul class="posts">
    <li><h2>[Who...am I?]:</h2><p>I am a born and raised Georgia native.  I enjoy playing pretty much any instrument I can get my hands on.  Aside from music, my hobbies include building and destroying electronics, working on small engines, gaming, and the renewed love of vegan cooking.  I am constantly looking for some new language or technology to play with and learn from.</br>Most importantly, I am ever dedicated to my beautiful wife and children.</p></li>
