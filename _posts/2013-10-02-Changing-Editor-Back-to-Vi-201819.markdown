So this is just a little test posting.  The purpose is to check the execution of this command in my `new_post` script: `vim --cmd ':set spell spelllang=en_us'`.  I am pleased to say that the spell check highlighting works beautifully.  Now I can comfortably type with confidence that the majority of my terrible spelling will be caught and I get the added joy of creating my posts in a text based editor I love.  Thats all for now!
